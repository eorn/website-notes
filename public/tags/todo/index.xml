      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been aware of the Fediverse for some time already. Basically this is a &amp;ldquo;Federated Universe&amp;rdquo; of different social networks, based on open protocols. You might have heard of Mastodon for example.
Well, after reading an article about it (French version - Italian original version), I want to get involved in it.
This summer I&amp;rsquo;m planning on building a new hardware server, and I&amp;rsquo;ll try to set up instances of Mastodon, PeerTube and FunkWhale.</description>

      <description>Following an idea from there, I&amp;rsquo;d like to write a small phone app to record my daily phone usage:
 number of times I switch the screen on number of apps used and their usage time &amp;hellip;  Ideally I would export all of that in a CSV file, and create some R scripts to plot all this (big) data.</description>

      <description>An idea, following the previous one: tracking my podcast consumption.
I&amp;rsquo;m already using the one of PodcastAddict, but this is not detailed enough.</description>
