      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m involved in a team organizing/stimulating technical workshops in the Marine Station of Roscoff, the so-called RUB (Roscoff Unseminars in Bio*).
We needed a support to exist online, and to share resources, as well as to collectively prepare the workshops. I got very inspired by the InSileco website, that makes use of Blogdown+Hugo, GitHub and Travis-CI. They even have a blog post on how to build such website. I hereby greatly thank them for the resources they shared.</description>
