      <description>Long time no see.
I&amp;rsquo;m planning to rebuild a new server, it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be really nice I&amp;rsquo;m excited about it.
Meanwhile, another project that would be interesting to do, in the long-term since I don&amp;rsquo;t have the skillz now: a federated open-source alternative to Strava. I like running and like to have stats about myself, and the social part of Strava is nice too.
I&amp;rsquo;ve ran into this project: PikaTrack which seems already pretty nice.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been aware of the Fediverse for some time already. Basically this is a &amp;ldquo;Federated Universe&amp;rdquo; of different social networks, based on open protocols. You might have heard of Mastodon for example.
Well, after reading an article about it (French version - Italian original version), I want to get involved in it.
This summer I&amp;rsquo;m planning on building a new hardware server, and I&amp;rsquo;ll try to set up instances of Mastodon, PeerTube and FunkWhale.</description>
