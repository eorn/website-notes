      <description>Following an idea from there, I&amp;rsquo;d like to write a small phone app to record my daily phone usage:
 number of times I switch the screen on number of apps used and their usage time &amp;hellip;  Ideally I would export all of that in a CSV file, and create some R scripts to plot all this (big) data.</description>

      <description>An idea, following the previous one: tracking my podcast consumption.
I&amp;rsquo;m already using the one of PodcastAddict, but this is not detailed enough.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m involved in a team organizing/stimulating technical workshops in the Marine Station of Roscoff, the so-called RUB (Roscoff Unseminars in Bio*).
We needed a support to exist online, and to share resources, as well as to collectively prepare the workshops. I got very inspired by the InSileco website, that makes use of Blogdown+Hugo, GitHub and Travis-CI. They even have a blog post on how to build such website. I hereby greatly thank them for the resources they shared.</description>

      <description>This small static website (built with blogdown and hugo) is a simple collection of ideas I (Ewen Corre) have. The idea followed the visit of a very similar website of the same type, created by Roel Hogervorst. As far as I know, he didn&amp;rsquo;t invent the concept either, he did the same as Sean Kross.
I hope this experiment will be funny and useful!</description>
