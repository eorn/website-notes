      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m involved in a team organizing/stimulating technical workshops in the Marine Station of Roscoff, the so-called RUB (Roscoff Unseminars in Bio*).
We needed a support to exist online, and to share resources, as well as to collectively prepare the workshops. I got very inspired by the InSileco website, that makes use of Blogdown+Hugo, GitHub and Travis-CI. They even have a blog post on how to build such website. I hereby greatly thank them for the resources they shared.</description>

      <description>This small static website (built with blogdown and hugo) is a simple collection of ideas I (Ewen Corre) have. The idea followed the visit of a very similar website of the same type, created by Roel Hogervorst. As far as I know, he didn&amp;rsquo;t invent the concept either, he did the same as Sean Kross.
I hope this experiment will be funny and useful!</description>
