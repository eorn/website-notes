      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m following an influencer (gosh, I&amp;rsquo;m so mainstream). This influencer is @FibreTigre. He developped a game called The beautiful Walk
Basically this is a platform that collects the km you walk or run (through applications like Strava), and makes your avatar walk around the world.
I started this week and I&amp;rsquo;m at km 32. My avatar left from Paris, and now I&amp;rsquo;m at &amp;ldquo;ForÃªt domaniale d&amp;rsquo;Armainvilliers&amp;rdquo;. Many adventures are yet to come!</description>

      <title>Phone app to record usage</title>

      <description>Following an idea from there, I&amp;rsquo;d like to write a small phone app to record my daily phone usage:
 number of times I switch the screen on number of apps used and their usage time &amp;hellip;  Ideally I would export all of that in a CSV file, and create some R scripts to plot all this (big) data.</description>

      <description>An idea, following the previous one: tracking my podcast consumption.
I&amp;rsquo;m already using the one of PodcastAddict, but this is not detailed enough.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m involved in a team organizing/stimulating technical workshops in the Marine Station of Roscoff, the so-called RUB (Roscoff Unseminars in Bio*).
We needed a support to exist online, and to share resources, as well as to collectively prepare the workshops. I got very inspired by the InSileco website, that makes use of Blogdown+Hugo, GitHub and Travis-CI. They even have a blog post on how to build such website. I hereby greatly thank them for the resources they shared.</description>
