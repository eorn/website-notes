Long time no see.

I'm planning to rebuild a new server, it's gonna be really nice I'm excited about it.

Meanwhile, another project that would be interesting to do, in the long-term since I don't have the skillz now: a federated open-source alternative to Strava.
I like running and like to have stats about myself, and the social part of Strava is nice too.

I've ran into [this project: PikaTrack](https://gitlab.com/pikatrack/pikatrack/wikis/user-guide) which seems already pretty nice. Don't know whether it is still active (last update dates from 9 month ago). And also it is written in Ruby (don't know anything about this language).
Nice project to contribute / get inspiration though!
