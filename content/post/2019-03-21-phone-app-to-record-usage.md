Following an idea from [there](https://blog.rmhogervorst.nl/blog/2019/01/28/logging-my-phone-use-with-tasker/), I'd like to write a small phone app to record my daily phone usage:

- number of times I switch the screen on
- number of apps used and their usage time
- ...

Ideally I would export all of that in a CSV file, and create some `R` scripts to plot all this (big) data.
