I've been aware of the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) for some time already. Basically this is a "*Federated Universe*" of different social networks, based on open protocols.
You might have heard of [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) for example.

Well, after reading an article about it ([French version](https://framablog.org/2019/03/07/la-fee-diverse-deploie-ses-ailes/) - [Italian original version](https://cagizero.wordpress.com/2018/12/18/mastodon-il-fediverso-ed-il-futuro-decentrato-delle-reti-sociali/)), I want to get involved in it.

This summer I'm planning on building a new hardware server, and I'll try to set up instances of [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org), [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org) and [FunkWhale](https://funkwhale.audio/).
I'm pretty excited about it huhu.
