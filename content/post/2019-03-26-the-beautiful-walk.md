I'm following an influencer (gosh, I'm so mainstream). This influencer is [@FibreTigre](https://twitter.com/fibretigre).
He developped a game called [*The beautiful Walk*](https://www.thebeautifulwalk.com)

Basically this is a platform that collects the km you walk or run (through applications like Strava), and makes your avatar walk around the world.

I started this week and I'm at km 32. My avatar left from Paris, and now I'm at "ForÃªt domaniale d'Armainvilliers". Many adventures are yet to come! As of today, I got a koala and I helped a scientist keep his "formula that represented his life of work"!

Here's where I am: [my walk](https://www.thebeautifulwalk.com/fr/user/eorn~36386798/wall)
