This small static website (built with [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and [`hugo`](https://gohugo.io/)) is a simple collection of ideas I ([Ewen Corre](https://ewen.corre.bio)) have.
The idea followed the visit of a [very similar website of the same type](https://notes.rmhogervorst.nl/), created by [Roel Hogervorst](https://blog.rmhogervorst.nl/).
As far as I know, he didn't invent the concept either, he did the same as [Sean Kross](http://seankross.com/2017/11/06/Enabling-Frequent-Brain-Dumps.html).

I hope this experiment will be funny and useful!
